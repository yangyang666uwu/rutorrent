## Description ##

This plugin adds a chatbox to multi-user rutorrent installs.  **_NOTE:  Currently this is a single server chat program only (if you have multiple servers, this will NOT allow your users to chat across them)_**



### Installation and usage ###

The 3rd party wiki has all of this information, i see no point in trying to maintain it in 2 locations.
