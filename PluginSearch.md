# Search Plugin #

---


## Description ##

This plugin makes it possible to modify the list of default search engines.  Once the plugin is installed, a new section called "Search" will apear in the "Settings" dialog. Each line in the list should contain a name of the search engine and URL for search in it. The name and the URL should be separated by a vertical line character. If the name is left empty, a horizontal line will be shown in the menu. The URL must be formatted in such a way that words added to the end would be processed by the search engine correctly.
