&lt;wiki:TOC /&gt;



## Description ##

The plug-in adds the columns 'Finished' and 'Added' to the torrents list. This columns contains the time when download of the torrent was completed and, accordingly, the time when torrent was added.
As example:

![http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/PluginSeedingtime/seedingtime.jpg](http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/PluginSeedingtime/seedingtime.jpg)

Of course the column contains values only for torrents completed/added after the plug-in installed.
