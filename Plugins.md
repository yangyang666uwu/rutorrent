# Plugins #

---




ruTorrent is designed with a robust plugin system.  The reason for this is to allow users to customize the behavior of the WebUI, and exlude the parts they do not need.

## Installation ##

To install a plugin, download the tarball from [the download page](http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/downloads/list) and extract it in the plugins directory. (if rutorrent is installed to /var/www/rutorrent this would be
```
/var/www/rutorrent/plugins
```
If you use the svn version of rutorrent, you can fetch the plugins via svn as well as follows:
```
svn co http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME
```

Attention! Please install only those plug-ins you really need. The more plug-ins are installed - the longer load of the ruTorrent interface.

**_(note: many plugins will require a commandline php installation to be set in rutorrent/conf/config.php (or rutorrent/conf/users/USERNAME/config.php).  Please check your distro for how to install. )_**
### plugins.ini ###

**_Some of the following information is also included in [Config page](Config#Limiting_Plugins_(plugins.ini).md)_**

Since 3.0, rutorrent includes a configuration file for plugins called plugin.ini.  It is located at rutorrent/conf/plugins.ini.  As of the writing of this wiki, the default format is as follows:

```
;; Plugin's permissions. 
;; If flag is not found in plugin section, corresponding flag from "default" section is used.
;; If flag is not found in "default" section, it is assumed to be "yes".
;;
;; For setting individual plugin's permissions you must write something like that:
;;
;; [ratio]
;; enabled = yes
;; canChangeToolbar = yes
;; canChangeMenu = yes
;; canChangeOptions = no
;; canChangeTabs = yes
;; canChangeColumns = yes

[default]
enabled = yes
canChangeToolbar = yes
canChangeMenu = yes
canChangeOptions = yes
canChangeTabs = yes
canChangeColumns = yes
```

These options allow you to change how each plugin behaves and allow you to create a unique configuration for multiple user systems.

For a multiuser system with rutorrent installed at /var/www/rutorrent with users tom dick and harry you would do something like:

```
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/plugins.ini /var/www/rutorrent/users/tom
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/plugins.ini /var/www/rutorrent/users/dick
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/plugins.ini /var/www/rutorrent/users/harry
```

and edit each accordingly.  For more information about multi-user setups, see [Config](Config.md) and [Installation](Installation#Single_user_(or_no_Web_Auth)_OR_Multiuser_(Web_Auth).md)

#### Explanation of plugin.ini settings ####

  * **enabled** - this setting should be obvious, when set to yes, a plugin is enabled.  When set to no, it is not.
  * **canChangeToolbar** - this setting controls whether or not a plugin can make changes to the main toolbar.
  * **canChangeMenu** - this setting controls whether or not the plugin can effect the rightclick menu.
  * **canChangeOptions** - this setting controls whether or not the plugin can add to the "Settings" menu.
  * **canChangeTabs** - this setting controls whether or not a plugin can add a tab to the tab bar.
  * **canChangeColumns** - this setting controls whether or not a plugin can add a data column to the torrent information window.

#### An Example of how to use plugins.ini ####

So why is this useful? Using our 3 user system from the earlier example, lets say
for harry and dick, you want to completely disable the [RSS](PluginRSS.md) plugin, but you wish to allow tom access to it. You would install [RSS](PluginRSS.md) and add the following to both **/var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/harry/plugins.ini** and **/var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/dick/plugins.ini**

```
[rss]
enabled = no
```

Lets say you want to let tom use the [unpack](PluginUnpack.md) plugin, but you do not want him to be able to enable "automatic unpack" via the settings window. You might add soemthing like this to **/var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom/plugins.ini**

```
[unpack]
enabled = yes               
canChangeToolbar = yes      
canChangeMenu = yes         
canChangeOptions = no      
canChangeTabs = yes         
canChangeColumns = yes
```

### per user plugin config files ###

In the new rutorrent 3.0 multi-user setup, it is possible to have different plugins config settings for each user.  This is done by creating a plugins directory for each user, adding a directory for the plugin you wish to have the config for, and copying the base plugin conf.php to this directory.  For example:  If you have 3 users, tom dick and harry, and you want to have different rss update intervals for each user, you would do something like this: _**(note: the following assumes rutorrent installed at /var/www/rutorrent )**_

```
mkdir -p /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom/plugins/rss
mkdir -p /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/dick/plugins/rss
mkdir -p /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/harry/plugins/rss
cp /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/rss/conf.php /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom/plugins/rss
cp /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/rss/conf.php /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/dick/plugins/rss
cp /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/rss/conf.php /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/harry/plugins/rss
```

then edit accordingly.  This works for all plugins which have a conf.php file.

### a note on upgrading plugins ###

It's very important to remember, when upgrading a plugin, you should always:
  1. stop rtorrent
  1. upgrade the plugin(s)
  1. restart rtorrent

Failure to stop/start rtorrent can result in plugins not behaving as you'd expect.


## Starting plugins with rtorrent ##

Plugins will load when the webui is opened.  If you have plugins which need to poll for data (like rss or scheduler) you may wish to have them start when rtorrent starts, regardless of whether or not the webui has been loaded.  In 2.0, this used to require a setting for each plugin via the .rtorrent.rc
Now, all plugins can be brought up with a single .rtorrent.rc command.  Be sure to edit this command for:
  1. php path **_Your path may be different_**
  1. rutorrent location **_Rutorrent may be installed in a different location on your syste_**
  1. webusername **_you may or may not be using web authentication, if you aren't, remove the username entirely, if you are, edit it accordingly_**

(the following is for user tom with rutorrent installed at /var/www/rutorrent)

```
execute = {sh,-c,/usr/bin/php /var/www/rutorrent/php/initplugins.php tom &}
```


**## Uninstallation ##**

  1. remove the plugin directory, for example, to remove the rpc plugin you might do this:
```
rm -r /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/rpc/
```
  1. restart rtorrent. _**This is important for plugins which work with the rtorrent scheduler, such plugins will send a command to rtorrent telling it to do something every x minutes. If you do not restart rtorrent, this even will keep occuring.**_
